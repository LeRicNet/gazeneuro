\title{Inject velocity-induced temporal-spatial error (Prediction 1)}
\usage{
inject_velocity_induced_error(gaze_data, sigma_latency = 0.02, dt = 1/120)
}
\arguments{
\item{gaze_data}{Gaze data frame with velocity column}

\item{sigma_latency}{Temporal uncertainty (seconds)}

\item{dt}{Sampling interval (seconds)}
}
\value{
Gaze data with induced spatial error added
}
\description{
Applies the theoretical prediction: σ_induced ≈ ||v_gaze|| · σ_δ
where temporal uncertainty creates larger spatial errors during fast movements.

The model: If there's temporal uncertainty σ_δ in when a gaze sample was taken,
and the eye was moving at velocity v, then the spatial error is approximately v * σ_δ.
