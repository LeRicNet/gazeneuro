\title{Validate velocity-spatial coupling (Prediction 1)}
\usage{
validate_velocity_coupling(gaze_data, sigma_latency = 0.02, n_bins = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{gaze_data}{Gaze data with velocity and induced error}

\item{sigma_latency}{Known latency uncertainty}

\item{n_bins}{Number of velocity bins}
}
\value{
List with validation results including r², slope, and expected slope
}
\description{
Tests whether σ_induced ≈ ||v_gaze|| · σ_δ holds in simulated data.

The prediction states that EXPECTED induced spatial error should be proportional
to velocity. Since individual samples have high variance, we bin by velocity
and test the relationship between mean error and velocity.
