\title{Calculate attention weights for gaze samples}
\usage{
calculate_attention_weights(
  data,
  weight_by_duration = TRUE,
  uncertainty_weighted = TRUE,
  velocity_halfweight = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with fixation detection (from detect_fixations())}

\item{weight_by_duration}{Weight samples by fixation duration}

\item{uncertainty_weighted}{Down-weight high-velocity samples}

\item{velocity_halfweight}{Velocity at which weight is halved (default: 0.05)}
}
\value{
Data frame with added 'attention_weight' column
}
\description{
Computes weights for each gaze sample based on fixation duration and
velocity-mediated uncertainty.
